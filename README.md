# Bayesian IRF matching extension to the BASE for HANK toolbox.

This package extends the [BASEforHANK](https://github.com/BASEforHANK/BASEtoolbox.jl} Toolbox for estimating medium-scale HANK models by a Bayesian Impulse Response Function Matching option. For an application, see "The Liquidity Channel of Fiscal Policy" by Christian Bayer, Benjamin Born and Ralph Luetticke ([link to paper](https://www.benjaminborn.de/publication/bbl_fiscal_2021/)).

Note that the example setup of the toolbox is not meant to replicate all the results in the paper.

To get started, clone or download the repository. The full documentation of the BASEforHANK toolbox can be found [here](https://baseforhank.github.io/BASEtoolbox.jl/}.
